# Unit Testing

- Use Vitest for unit testing.
- Vitest API are globally available, so you don't need to import them (e.g., `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and so on).
- Prefer `it` over `test` for naming test cases.
- Prefer `it.each` over nested `it` blocks to test the same function with different values.
