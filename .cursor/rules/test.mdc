# Test files

## Files and directories

- Unit test files should be colocated in the same directory that includes the test target file.
- Test file name should end with `spec.ts`.

## Test rules

- Use Vitest for unit testing.
- Explicitly import Vitest APIs (e.g., `import { describe, it } from 'vitest'`).
- Prefer `it` over `test` for naming test cases.
- Write test names and conditions in English inside `describe` and `it`
- Run `bun test path/to/xxx.spec.ts --run` to run tests without watch mode.
