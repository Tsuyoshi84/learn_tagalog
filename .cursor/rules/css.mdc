# CSS rules

These rules should be applied to CSS files and Vue component `<style>` section.

- Use modern CSS features as much as possible, assuming users always use the latest browser versions.
- Use logical properties—for example, `inline-size` instead of `width`.
- Use OKLCH for colors—no need for RGB / HSL fallback.
- Prefer individual transform properties (`translate`, `rotate`, `scale`) over the `transform` shorthand.
- Animation duration should be 0.2s.
- Don't use BEM naming convention for CSS classes.
- Use CSS nesting to change styles based on the state.
