# CSS rules

These rules should be applied to CSS files and Vue component `<style>` section.

- Use modern CSS features as much as possible, assuming users always use the latest browser versions.
- Use logical properties—for example, `inline-size` instead of `width`.
- Use OKLCH for colors—no need for RGB / HSL fallback.
- Prefer individual transform properties (`translate`, `rotate`, `scale`) over the `transform` shorthand.
- Animation duration should be 0.2s.
- Don't use BEM naming convention for CSS classes.
- Use CSS nesting to change styles based on the state.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming and maintainability.
- Prefer `clamp()` for responsive typography and spacing.
- Use `aspect-ratio` for maintaining consistent proportions.
- Prefer `gap` over margins for spacing in flexbox and grid layouts.
- Use `:where()` for lower specificity when possible.
- Prefer `rem` units for typography and `em` for component-relative sizing.
- Use `@container` queries for component-based responsive design.
- Prefer `:is()` and `:where()` pseudo-classes for cleaner selectors.
- Consider RTL support when using logical properties for potential future language expansion.
- Use `font-variant-ligatures` appropriately for text rendering.
- Consider `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` for better text clarity in learning contexts.
